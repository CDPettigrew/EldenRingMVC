## Application Goal

```
The goal of this application was to create a database of items in Elden Ring to allow players 
to find those items and there locations 
with ease. It could also be reconfigured to follow a players progress and track 
the location they've been to and the items they've found.
(This would require most of the seed data to be removed.)
```

## Extra
The app is deployed to azure but the views are still being adjusted to work properly.
